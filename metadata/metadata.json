    "desc": "Given the increasing complexity of machine learning models, the need for model explainability has been growing lately. Some governments have also introduced stricter regulations that mandate a right to explanation from machine learning models. In this solution, we take a look at how Amazon SageMaker can be used to explain individual predictions from machine learning models.",
